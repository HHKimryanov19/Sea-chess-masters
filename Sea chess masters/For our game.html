<p class="paragraph"> The idea of ​​our game is for fun. When you are bored, you can play it, so we make sea chess (Tic tac toe). There are two reasons for playing Tic tac toe:
1. We had a school project in which we had to do a math game.
2. Because we thought for a long time what it should be and after a while we had made a game that was about basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), but in one of our meetings it was a member of the team presented us with a code for sea chess and then we decided to do sea chess (Tic tac toe) because we thought it would be more fun and we hope it was &#128512. </p>
